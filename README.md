# DSA Visualizer

## Overview

The DSA Visualizer is a project designed to illustrate and help understand various data structures and algorithms through interactive visualizations. This tool includes visual representations of binary tree (BT) traversals and sorting algorithms, providing a clear and engaging way to grasp these fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Features

- **Binary Tree Traversals:**
  - In-order Traversal
  - Pre-order Traversal
  - Post-order Traversal
  - Level-order Traversal

- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** [JavaScript, html, css]
- **Libraries:** [D3.js for visualizations]
- **Tools:** [Specify any tools used for development, e.g., Git for version control, Webpack for bundling]

## Installation
